## How to start Development  
In Windows environment, execute **startWorking.bat** in the root directory. It doesn't do some ground breaking stuff but saves at least 2 minutes of developer when she starts development.  
It does two things for you,  
**ionic serve** - Run local express server and execute application over there. Further it listens for any change being made and reflects it.  
**gulp watch** - It listens for any change in SASS files and translate it to CSS files
